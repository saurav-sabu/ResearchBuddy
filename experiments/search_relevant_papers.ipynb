      "We investigated the effect of dropping the last layers from\n",

      "attention sublayers lead to much lower drops in performance\n",
      "than dropping the MLP sublayers, whether the last layer\n",
      "is included or not, while also leading to better inference\n",
      "speedups. For example, removing 33% of attention layers\n",
      "leads to an 18% speedup in a 13B Llama2 model at the cost\n",
      "of a 1.8% drop in average performance. This shows that\n",
      "massive improvements can be made over dropping entire\n",

      "The Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) benchmark is built on the implementation by Bai et al. (2024).\n",
      "The task in NIAH is to retrieve a specific sentence from a context that is filled with irrelevant text.\n",
      "The to-be-retrieved information is called the needle, and the whole context, including the irrelevant\n",
      "text and the needle, is called the haystack. The benchmark evaluates the ability of a model to retrieve\n",
      "the needle from the haystack for multiple prompts of different lengths. Through strategic prompt\n",
      "generation, this benchmark can yield retrieval maps that unveil the retrieval performance of a model,\n",
      "depending on the position of the needle and the size of the haystack. See Figure 4 for examples of\n",
      "such a retrieval map. Following Bai et al. (2024), we used the same collection of essays from Paul\n",
      "Graham3 to generate the haystack, as well as the same needle.\n",
      "The needle was \"The best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on a\n",
      "sunny day\". The retrieval question was \"What is the best thing to do in San Francisco?\".\n",
      "We chose a maximum prompt length of 4096 tokens. For each tokenizer, 100 prompts were generated:\n",
      "ten prompt lengths at ten depths.\n",
      "As an improvement over the scoring method used by Zani et al. (2025), which was a simple binary\n",
      "string matching evaluation, we implemented granular scoring. While still based on string matching,\n",
      "partial matches were allowed to yield partial scores. For each keyword of the needle that was present\n",
      "in the output string, the score was increased. The scores for all partial keywords added up to three.\n",
      "If the full needle string matched, the score was set to five. While examining outputs from test\n",
      "experiments on Jamba, we stumbled across a curious phenomenon: the grammatically imperfect\n",
      "needle was predicted with corrected grammar, thereby only scoring three points. To visualize this\n",
